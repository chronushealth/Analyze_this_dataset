# Analyze this dataset

# Problem 1: Tell me more about this data set
Take a look at two time series data files, the data set is a single column data set 
* signal_1.dat
* signal_2.dat

## Information about the dataset
* signal_1.dat is a measured signal for 1s. Data is sampled at Fs = 50MHz. Records multiple events. 
* signal_2.dat is a single pulse giving characteristic information about an event occuring. 
* Measurement are from an electrical signal

For both datasets, height, width and area under the pulse give us characteristic information about the event. 

## Task and questions
* Use signal_1 to learn more about the event. What are you inferences
* Signal_2 is a ideal single pulse. Using signal_2, what can you infer about signal_1
* Can you infer anything about the noise characteristics

## Time
Not more than 2 hrs
